# MusicPad (hackpad) 🔧🎶

[](/assets/p2.png)

**MusicPad** (aka *hackpad*) is a small, open-hardware music controller project. It's a compact pad/button-based interface intended to control music(spotify, youtube and such). This repository contains the PCB design, 3D case model, and an early, in-progress firmware prototype.

---

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Create a compact, user-friendly music control pad that connects to a host (USB) and provides tactile controls and a small display for feedback.
- **What's included:**
  - PCB design files (`PCB/` — KiCad files)
  - 3D model / assembly file for the case (`CAD/MusicPadAss.3mf`)
  - Firmware prototype (`Firmware/main.py`)

---

## Features (planned)

- Small form-factor PCB with keyboard keys
- On-board OLED for status/feedback
- USB connectivity
- Easily re-flashable firmware for experimentation



## Firmware status ⚠️

**The firmware is not finished.** I plan to continue and complete the firmware once I have the hardware in hand to test and iterate on behavior with the real device.(Its just the basic tutorial code!)
