**MusicPad** is a small, open-hardware music controller project. It's a compact thingy intended to control music(spotify, youtube and such). This repository contains the PCB design, 3D case model, and firmware.

## Project Overview

- **Where the stuff is**
  - PCB design files (`PCB/` KiCad files)
  - 3D model / assembly file for the case (`CAD/MusicPadAss.step`)
  - Firmware prototype (`Firmware/main.py`)

---



## Firmware status 

**The firmware is not finished.** I plan to continue and complete the firmware once I have the hardware in hand to test and iterate on behavior with the real device.(Its just the basic tutorial code!)
